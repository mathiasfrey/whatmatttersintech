Marc Andreessen’s 
[visionary 2011 statement](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)
has turned into a reality. Today, software is all over the place and it’s
here to stay. This blog is about people – people building tech for people using
tech. Understanding the complexities of the
software world is a key skill one could not overestimate.

My early days as a coder were almost purely about putting HTML fragments
together so that they would eventually make up some website. But the software
I’ve written later on is now reading measurements from huge sensor networks,
opening doors, moving money or turning on the light bulb just right next to me.
The global economy has simply shifted from building real things to writing
software: Just remember the day when you bought tapes instead of downloading
music or a camera whose pictures came to life thanks to a chemical process
instead of data processing. Even newspapers were curated by a human beings back
then! 

News articles are now called content, flooding us in torrent-like feeds. My
personalised one is currently focused on Boeing’s software bug that lead to two
fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. At the same time this very content
filter algorithm presents me with some hype around self-driving cars, an
engineering challenge larger by several magnitudes than simply controlling an
airplane's pitch. Apparently, software defects can harm lives but this won't
stop anyone from deploying more code in whatever context.

The old economy still struggles with what’s now called _Digitization_ – be it
the fact that companies accidentally lose millions of customer records or suffer 
from the diseconomies of software development. Eventually they all have to learn
the follwing paradox the hard way: Software is not constrained by the
[perversity of matter](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-mec-india.html) 
which - against common intuition - makes it more difficult to build and
maintain. As software is purely about people's knowledge - generation and
sharing thereof - standardization or other classical management approaches 
often fail. 

Admittedly, the domain whatmattersin.tech carries a bold statement: Claiming to
write about what actually mattered in the huge field of technology deliberately
is megalomaniac. Nonetheless, throughout my career I’ve collected my takeaways,
mostly by cooperating and jointly growing with inspiring people.

This blog is about people – people building tech for people using tech to solve
their problems. Ultimately, people are whatmattersin.tech
